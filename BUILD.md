# Build Instructions

## To run the app (development):
```bash
npm start
```

## To build the executable:
```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an installer in the `dist/` folder.

After building, you'll find:
- `dist/Personal Notion Setup 1.0.0.exe` - Installer
- Or the unpacked app in `dist/win-unpacked/`

## To run without terminal:
After building, you can:
1. Install using the Setup.exe
2. Launch from Start Menu or Desktop shortcut
3. No need to run `npm start` anymore!
